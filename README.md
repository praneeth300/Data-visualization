Visualizing statistical relationships Statistical analysis is a process of understanding how variables in a dataset relate to each other and how those relationships depend on other variables. Visualization can be a core component of this process because, when data are visualized properly, the human visual system can see trends and patterns that indicate a relationship.  1. Numerical Data Ploting relplot() scatterplot() lineplot() 2. Categorical Data Ploting catplot() boxplot() stripplot() swarmplot() etc... 3. Visualizing Distribution of the Data distplot() kdeplot() jointplot() rugplot() 4. Linear Regression and Relationship regplot() lmplot()
